# Sequential Logic Design Project - Seven Segment Display

This is a digital circuits design project, where the objective was to get a 7-segment display (7SD) to cycle through my student number using sequential logic design. The following design flow was followed: logic synthesis, K-mapping, optimizations for number of gates used, simulation in NI Multisim, build and physically implement this design (using only logic gate ICs, wires, and a 7SD chip). A very detailed dive into logic design and optimization (of small digital circuits) was performed.

Please find videos of the simulation and physical implementation in the repository, in addition to the writeup!
